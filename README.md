# Personal Webpage — Charter & Guide  
**Rajib Bora**

## Purpose

This repository supports the creation and evolution of my personal webpage.

The webpage exists as a **single, owned, authoritative representation** of my professional identity, thinking, and work. It is designed to provide high-signal context for serious audiences and to demonstrate the principles behind **ICDT (Integrated Cognitive Digital Twin)** in practice.

This is not a marketing site. It is a thinking surface.

---

## What This Webpage Is — and Is Not

### It **IS**
- A credibility and context hub
- A curated surface of thinking + execution
- A long-lived asset that evolves deliberately
- A reference I can confidently share with partners, advisors, and peers

### It **IS NOT**
- A résumé replacement
- A social feed or blog treadmill
- A personal branding exercise
- A LinkedIn clone

Clarity and substance take precedence over volume and frequency.

---

## Primary Audiences

This site is intentionally built for:
- Strategic partners and collaborators
- MIT xPRO faculty, advisors, and peers
- Executive recruiters and board-level contacts
- Technically literate readers interested in AI, digital twins, and systems thinking

It is not optimized for casual browsing.

---

## Core Principles

The webpage must always adhere to the following principles:

1. **Ownership**  
   Narrative, structure, and content are fully controlled by me.

2. **Signal over Noise**  
   Fewer pages, fewer words, higher density.

3. **Timelessness**  
   Avoid time-sensitive content unless it has enduring value.

4. **Narrative Coherence**  
   All sections reinforce a single arc: operator → architect → platform builder.

5. **Forward-Looking**  
   Emphasize what is being built and learned, not just what has been done.

## Canonical Site Structure

The initial version of the site should remain minimal and structured as follows:

### 1. Home / About
- Who I am
- What I am currently building and exploring
- Operating philosophy
- Concise positioning statement

### 2. Projects
Curated descriptions of:
- **ICDT** — Integrated Cognitive Digital Twin
- **InterviewGate™** — Career Concierge / Digital Twin
- **Oilfield Operations Digital Twin** — Arahas pilot (anonymized)

Each project should highlight:
- The problem
- The architectural idea
- The execution mindset

### 3. Writing / Thinking
- Selected reflections
- MIT xPRO synthesis
- Architecture notes
- Published only when insight is durable

### 4. Contact
- Professional and uncluttered
- Designed for intentional outreach

Optional future section:
- **Now** — current quarterly focus (kept sparse)

---

## Tone and Voice

The tone of the site should be:
- Calm
- Precise
- Reflective
- Technically literate
- Executive in posture

Avoid:
- Buzzwords
- Marketing language
- Over-selling
- Excessive autobiography

---

## Relationship to ICDT

This personal webpage is intentionally aligned with ICDT philosophy:

- It represents my **first public, curated digital twin**
- It demonstrates:
  - Intentional memory
  - Narrative continuity
  - Human–AI collaboration principles
- In the future, it may:
  - Be powered by my own concierge
  - Expose selected “safe” lenses of a deeper private twin

The site is both **artifact and proof-of-concept**.

---

## Technical Posture

The site should:
- Be simple to host
- Be version-controlled
- Avoid unnecessary infrastructure complexity
- Favor longevity and portability

Technology choices must support thinking — not distract from it.

---

## Update Philosophy

Updates should be:
- Intentional
- Infrequent
- Meaningful

There is no obligation to post regularly.  
Silence is acceptable. Substance is mandatory.

---

## Success Criteria

The webpage is successful if:
- It shortens the time needed for others to understand my work
- It attracts the *right* conversations
- It reflects my thinking accurately over time
- I feel comfortable sharing it without explanation

---

## Status

- **Document Type:** Charter / Guide
- **Status:** Active
- **Change Policy:** Evolve slowly; revise only with clear intent
